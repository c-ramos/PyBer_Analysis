# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

For this project, I analyzed all of Pyber's rideshare data from three city types. I also took data from January to early May of 2019 and created a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

## Results
The Pyber Summary Dataframe provides an overview of Pyber's services in three city types: rural, suburban, and urban cities. Between January 2019 - May 2019, based on the figures below, urban cities contributed the most to Pyber's total rides. Urban cities had 1,625 rides, suburban had 625, and rural 125 rides.

### Total drivers by city type

### Total fares

### Average fare per ride
Based on the table below, rural areas ($34.62) pay almost ten dollars more per ride than urban areas ($24.53). The average fare per ride in suburban areas is about in the middle at $30.97.

### Average fare per driver
The average fare per driver is $55.49 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $16.57 in urban cities.

### Total fare by city type
Urban areas collect the most fares at $39,854.38, almost ten times more than rural areas ($4,327.93). Suburban areas collected about $19,000.

## Summary
Based on this analysis, the following are my recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types: 
- In rural areas, there is an opportunity to increase the number of drivers. It is the lowest of all of the city types and the average fare per rider is the highest. 
- In suburban areas, there is also an opportunity to increase the number of drivers.
- Pyber users are concentrated in urban areas, both in terms of drivers and riders. Since the average fare per rider is lower in cities, there may be opportunity to increase the fare since this city type makes the most revenue.
